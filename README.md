# InsuleaseServer

# Project Name: Insul-Ease 

*Insul-ease is a web application that provides bolus insulin dose calculation, logging of blood sugars, and a convenient platform to communicate relevant data to patients, caregivers, and healthcare practitioners for patients with type 1 diabetes who are unhappy with pen-and-paper methods and expensive, confusing, and incomplete apps. Insul-ease provides access to recipes along with their nutrition facts to better manage carbohydrate counts. Providers recommend nutritious recipes, and patients may view and save the recommendations by their provider, as well as other providers.*

*Future Improvements:*

* Insulease landing page needs updates to the calculator functionality to allow entry of Mealtime Targets, Correction Factors and Carb Ratios. 
* Resposive Design should be implemented for small devices/screens. 
* Upon saving a recipe, the user is required to log out and back in to see the saved recipe, this functionality needs work. 
* Doctor and Patient interaction needs improvement.
